# Hotel-Booking-Dataset-Analysis
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis project where we have a dataset of many hotels, the dataset having 1lakh+ rows. The problem I am trying to solve is
the increase in cancellation of reserved hotels.
I have first clensed the data by removing unnecessary attributes, missing values and outliers. Then using tools in matplotlib, I have visualized the 
data to get to the root of the problem and then using the visualizations, suggested some solutions to the hotels to implement to solve this problem.
